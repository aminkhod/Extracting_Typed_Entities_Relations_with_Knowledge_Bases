as your relative , you know . 
israeli police were not immediately available for comment , but palestinian sources in hebron said mahmoud qawasmi was a 21-year-old student with links to the islamic radical group hamas . 
echoing blair , bush said the un would play a role in all aspects of post-war iraq , from humanitarian aid to a future interim authority , adding that iraq would `` move as quickly as possible '' to an interim authority made up of iraqis from inside and outside the country . 
israeli forces moved into hebron 's al-sheikh district where his family lived and arrested qawasmi 's brother and father after the bombing , they said . 
john king , that whole issue of homeland security must be so much on the minds of so many government officials , given the level of the terror alert today . 
she 's gets into the holiday spirit and wants every light , you know , in the city on our house and , you know , tree in her room , that kind of thing . 
however , when pressed on what precisely the un role would be , bush on tuesday mentioned only humanitarian work , `` suggesting '' people to staff the interim authority and helping iraq `` progress . '' 
reporter : so far , so good is the assessment we 're getting from senior administration officials as they try to track what they worry about most . 
eh , i used to , um , celebrate it with my grandmother -- and we 'd always have a midnight service at church . 
the iraqi people will decide who 's on the iraqi interim authority , '' said bush . 
without claiming responsibility , hamas and another hardline group , islamic jihad , said the blast was revenge for a string of bloody israeli army raids into the gaza strip in recent weeks . 
do you go to a lot of parties with friends , neighbors , co-workers or family members ? 
as we have the strikes overseas throughout iraq , there will be retaliatory terror strikes , either by organized terrorist networks or sympathetic terrorists or people against the united states in this country . 
but the palestinian authority condemned the attack , saying it would divert international sympathy away from the far higher palestinian civilian death toll . 
bush did not spell out how much power the united nations would have , nor did he elaborate on washington 's plans to place us officials alongside iraqis in the interim administration . 
do you travel to meet up with family or friends during the holidays ? 
he 's the most senior of about a handful of senior administration officials , including the vice president and the secretary of state . 
hi , i 'm mildred from west virginia . 
the palestinian leadership said the attack would serve as `` a pretext for israel 's government and occupation army to step up its deadly campaign which caused the deaths of 77 palestinians in february '' . 
well , i 'm in alabama . 
the national security advisor fanning out , we 're told in phone calls to more than three dozen world leaders offering them an update on what is going on .

in the january attack , two palestinian suicide bombers blew themselves up in central tel aviv , killing 23 other people . 
differences still remain between the united states and britain , analysts said , over the speed with which iraq should be handed to an interim iraqi administration , and the extent to which a us-led group of generals and former diplomats should effectively run the country . 
israeli government spokesman avi pazner called the latest deadly blast a `` very grave attack '' and said the jewish state would take '' vigorous action against the terrorist organisations '' . 
i 've been to your lovely state once before , down in the hollers .

i have two sisters that lived in alabama . 
the president offered a brief statement in the cabinet room . 
'' we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , '' bush vowed at the joint news conference with blair , adding that the interim authority would serve until a permanent government could be chosen by the iraqi people . 
no , i 'm in the northern part of the state . 
call my cabinet together to review our strategies , to make the world more peaceful , to make our country more secure .

a lot of bridges between where the 3 7 cavalry and the rest of the u.s. forces are now and their ultimate destination , downtown baghdad . 
and on tuesday , israeli troops shot dead an elderly palestinian shepherd outside a jewish settlement on the edge of gaza city . 
how many bridges in this city alone ? 
- well , my sister usually comes in from ohio because it 's not that far like -- two hundred fifty miles or something , and she 'll come in for thanksgiving . 
seven prosecutors read in turn the indictment against ba'asyir at the makeshift court room in the meteorology and geophysics agency 's office in central jakarta . 
in this map we have right here , 13 major bridges in downtown baghdad , including the expressway bridge over here . 
police believed ba'asyir was the spiritual leader of jemaah islamiyah , the terrorist network in southeast asia which is widely blamed for the bali bombing . 
in the west bank , an eight-year-old palestinian boy as well as his brother and a sister were wounded late wednesday by israeli gunfire in a village north of the town of ramallah , their elder sister said .

`` no one would be allowed to live in pakistan illegally and use its land for achieving their nefarious designs , '' information minister sheikh rashid ahmed said on friday . 
the world 's most powerful fine art auction houses , sotheby 's and christie 's , have agreed to pay 40 million dollars to settle an international price-fixing scam , sotheby 's said . 
this is one technique , one possible way u.s. forces might seize a bridge , a bridge that might be defended by iraqis . 
rashid ahmed made the remarks when his attention was drawn to the recent visit by afghan president hamid karzai , according to the associated press of pakistan . 
as we turn the other direction , what you 'll see are these iraqi tanks that are kind of fortified there . 
'' under the terms of the settlement agreement , sotheby 's and christie 's will each pay 20 million dollars , '' said sotheby 's , which operates in 34 countries . 
pakistan , he said , would benefit immensely from stability in afghanistan as its trade with central asian countries will take place through it . 
in december 2001 , a manhattan jury convicted sotheby 's main shareholder and former chairman alfred taubman of entering into a price-fixing agreement with christie 's . 
again , today , there were disturbing hints , and we underscore hints here , that coalition forces may soon face an attack using chemical weapons . 
reporting for us , cnn 's david ensor . 
referring to al-qaeda , musharraf said that no non-pakistani would be allowed to live in pakistan without proper documents . 
reporter : the evidence is accumulating that iraq may be planning to use chemical weapons . 
four months later , the billionaire was sentenced to one year in prison and a 7.5-million-dollar fine over the price-fixing , which prosecutors said had cost clients of both firms 400 million dollars . 
in nasiriyah in a building marked as a hospital u.s. marines found weapons , atropine antidote kits , and that was not all . 
christie 's was not prosecuted in the united states after its management agreed to testify against sotheby 's and provide documents needed to prove fraudulent intent . 
three family members of british muslim omar sharif , who is wanted for the april 30 suicide bomb attack in israel , were remanded in custody after appearing in a london court on friday with charges in connection with the blast . 
they found over 3,000 chemical suits and gas masks as well as a number of iraqi military uniforms . 
i was n't in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside bagdad airport but i had long thought and i was in iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , was essentially nonsensical because in 1990 , saddam hussein made the only self criticism . 
israeli authorities have claimed sharif , 27 , from derby , was on the run after failing to blow himself up in the attack on a tel aviv bar . 
reporter : the findings are heightening concerns among coalition forces approaching baghdad since , as the iraqis should know , u.s. and british forces do not use chemical weapons . 
um , i -- my roommate , and i still do n't know that much about -- i 'd love to know more about politics and i 'm trying to learn more , uh , tells me , you know , he was such a terrible man but , eh , i do n't listen to everything he says . 
the little town i was in this southern iraq , as far as i got , i ca n't boast of further , is where the talks took place . 
six non-permanent members of the security council considered to be in the middle ground between the fiercely pro- and anti-war camps , were working on new proposals to break the deadlock , france 's ambassador to the un said . 
three people were killed and about 50 injured when another briton , asif muhammad hanif , 21 , from london , detonated explosives strapped to his body . 
and i agree that we should n't send people over there . 
u.s. officials say some intelligence indicates a red line may have been drawn around the capital with republican guard units ordered to use chemical weapons once u.s. and allied troops cross it . 
do you mind if we keep your helicopters in the air just to be able to transport things ? 
my parents never took me to church or anything . 
british anti-terror police arrested six people altogether in derbyshire , central england , and london on may 2 and 3 . 
there is also intelligence , officials say , suggesting republican guard units have been issued artillery shells containing chemical agents . 
they use the gunships to kill , we think , not less than 50,000 inhabitants of southern iraq and trying to do that to the kurds , as well , so it was a knife edge . 
and it 's not just been wise after the event , i believe , to say that there was an argument in realtime between the bush administration members . 
there has been intelligence scraps , who knows how accurate they are , chatter in the system , that suggests that the closer that coalition forces get to baghdad and tikrit the greater the likelihood and that some command and control arrangements have been put in place . 
just like iraq ye - eh , we try to go in and get peace and - and how long has it been and , i mean , i think saddam needed to be removed but it 's - -- there 's just -- s - all these people that are going to follow him no matter what . 
the farc sought the exchange of more than 70 politicians , soldiers and policemen in its control for nearly 500 rebels imprisoned by the government , said luis devia , also known as raul reyes , a farc leader , in a letter sent to the program noticias uno . 
reporter : in baghdad deputy prime minister tariq aziz repeated his government 's stand -- it does not have any kind of weapons of mass destruction . 
it hurts to think of how many wonderful people in iraq at the academic community , lawyers , human rights activists , civilians , intellectuals , people -- would now be alive . 
the victims were antioquia governor guillermo gaviria , former defense minister gilberto echeverry and eight soldiers . 
the 17,000-strong farc , the largest guerrilla force in colombia , has been fighting a war against the government for more than 40 years , leaving 400,000 dead . 
reporter : experts say saddam hussein 's forces will likely try to hold out in baghdad for as long as possible without using the weapons his government insists it does not have , hoping to build international pressure on the u.s. and britain to back down . 
reporter : it was the lead story across connecticut in early april , police say jennifer o'conner , a connecticut woman with a history of psychiatric problems confessed to shooting her daughter 7 , while the 7 - year-old girl lay sleeping . 
the philippine presidential palace friday dismissed as an `` old tune '' deposed leader joseph estrada 's claim that he was still the country 's legitimate president . 
o'conner told police she could no longer cope with her daughter daughter 's learning , disability prps sara dade three days later . 
thomas , owner a local gun and motorcycle shop , said he felt gutted when he saw the news reports of o'conner 's vest on murder charges . 
presidential chief of staff rigoberto tiglao said estrada 's camp was trying to revive the issue on the legality of president gloria macapagal-arroyo 's administration when this was upheld twice by the supreme court . 
as soon as the police officers pulled the gun out and held it up , i knew it was my rifle . 
reporter : had sold oconer the rifle a few months before . 
meanwhile , the court shrugged off the claim of estrada 's lawyer alan paguia that its ruling on the legitimacy of the arroyo administration was illegal and cautioned that the tribunal 's decision was final and could not be overturned by the sandiganbayan . 
he sent oconeor 's information to the state authoritys for a background check . 
a former fbi informant accused of being a double agent has been indicted . 
the sandiganbayan special division friday reset for june 16 the resumption of estrada 's plunder case hearing , which was originally scheduled for june 2 . 
charles feldman is in los angeles with details on this one . 
estrada , who was ousted in a military-backed popular revolt in january 2001 , has been detained for almost two years at the veterans memorial medical center in metro manila on plunder charges . 
just one day after a former fbi counterintelligence agent was indicted on charges of gross negligence , his mistress of two decades , katrina leung , was herself indicted on more serious charges of copying and possessing documents relating to the national security of the united states . 
documents she allegedly lifted on many occasions from the briefcase of her ex-fbi handler , james smith . 
reporter : leung , a prominent chinese-american , was practically the toast of l.a. she was seemingly present for just about every event involving local politicians , sometimes national ones , and various high-ranking officials of the chinese government . 
leung was hired by the fbi and paid almost $ 2 million over 20 years to spy on the chinese . 
federal prosecutors now say she pulled a fast one and actually spied on the u.s. for the chinese . 
the wizards may not want jordan , but the head of the expansion team says jordan could run operations there , if he wants to . 
it 's his home state after all . 
on wednesday , washington wizards ' owner ended the three-year association with jordan . 
cnn 's josie karp has the story . 
reporter : for the first time since being cut from the team in high school , michael jordan was left in the awkward position of being unwanted by the game he has come to define . 
after playing the last two seasons with the washington wizards , jordan said he expected to return to the front office . 
instead , during a meeting that lasted only minutes , team owner told jordan his services were no longer necessary . 
a national weeklong terror drill began in seattle and an industrial lot in the city . 
no one has ever been arrested in connection with that case and the fbi is considering draining a maryland pond relating to evidence for those unsolved attacks . 
reporter : the fbi 's interest in this state park in maryland dates back to last december . 
officials got a tip back then that someone may have dumped equipment into one of the park 's ponds . 
officials say they found the tip significant because the pond is about ten miles from fort dietrick where the army experimented with anthrax . 
the police chief dine is in regular contact with the fbi . 
reporter : according to government sources , agents in december found a large plastic enclosed container with large openings on the side .

uh uh and it it could be done so easily because i - i - most small towns are protected by a small town police force .

yeah , i went there ( ( before ) ) 
i mean i , there 's a lot lot more people dense population up there than there is in in texas and they probably would have uh the pol - uh the police chief would probably know -- well what can work in like , airports or , you know , things , situations like that . 
but i , it did n't -- i ca n't remember his name , but -- the , i saw an interview with him , and -- how he , uh -- ran new york and uh -- you know , some of the -- ru - you know , they changed some of the rules , uh -- uh , not rules , but the way they -- uh 
well , the homeless people -- i guess , they need their shopping cart , so they kind of went elsewhere , so -- um -- i mean it 's a small thing , but it was , they just figured out , they were -- you know , uh -- learning from experience on what they need to do in the -- city and -- i think he would be a good -- candidate for the homeland security , running that . 
um -- like , uh -- well , it was -- colin powell was secretary , was he secretary of state ? 
you know , she may be -- uh uh uh , you know , uh -- a uh bush yes person , you know , i do n't know , uh

and you know and i think the media made him guilty , and i think -- it 's like you know , i mean you saw what happened outside the courtroom , i do n't know if you did or not , see how they were cheering on . 
i think he 's wrong , what he did , everything , he cheated on his wife , that 's so wrong , but -- that does n't make him a murderer , he 's just a cheater , he 's just a -- you know , like one hundred ten percent you know eighteen karat -- asshole , like i - mar - mark geragos called him . 
but uh no i - the -- uh the i think well first of all , you know i agree with you , i think cheating on your wife 's pretty low .

um , it 's northern california . 
i 'm in south carolina . 
i live in redwood city , which they actually moved the trial here a couple months into it . 
um , from modesto , california .

did you all know laci , or ? 
um , a friend of mine 's sister used to work in a maternity wear store and laci peterson , the day before she disappeared , was in her store maternity shopping . 
so , yeah , it was my friend 's sister -- who lives in modesto . 
so , it 's now getting wind to your area . 
peterson trial scott peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife laci and their unborn son , and he now faces the death penalty . 
he -- killed his wife when she was -- eight months pregnant and -- and dumped her in , uh -- the ocean , basically . 
very sad cause she has a child herself and so she drug her son through a lot of -- uh , drama that he did n't need to be part of . 
she has a son too , so he he also got put -- um -- you know , in the spotlight a bit , from what i understand . 
of -- of his girlfriend , yeah . 
they have many many worse crimes going on in california , parents killing their children and everything , that you would think -- would would , um -- you know , be 
i never really got the whole -- watching it on ~ tv and and getting into the whole -- mystery of it because , in the end , the woman 's dead and so is her child and -- and -- there 's -- really no way of changing that i guess . 
oh yeah and what 's going on in , i know and people -- flock , flock to the store to buy all their -- all their foreign made goods and it 's like what are you -- doing ? 
we have three kids . 
i could not sit around all day and watch a murder trial on ~ tv , especially with my kids around . 
peterson trial scott peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife laci and their unborn son , and he now faces the death penalty . 
yeah , and , um , i only know about yasser arafat because i , um , study international affairs a little bit -- and i know -- a very little bit about him because , of course he was a , um , leader for a long time , longer than the age that i am -- old , so , but i - i - i - i 've noticed -- on throughout my studies that -- what he represented to the public -- was -- what he represented to the international public -- was not what he was representing to his people -- and he was representing , um , peace with the israelis and he was representing trying to find ( ( the whites or ) ) divide the land so that it would be , um , stop , um , uh , war and terrorists in the area . 
but i do n't think that he had the same image to - to his people . 
death of arafat ( 1 ) controversial plo leader yasser arafat died in a paris hospital last week . 
um , to hi - -- yeah , i - -- i think he did what he thought -- was right for his people . 
i - i - -- i would say he was a good leader -- for - -- for , uh , his people . 
for example , before , eh , during clinton , i believe at that time -- clinton was trying hard -- to solve this problem and i believe at that time , if you remember , um , yasser arafat -- and , uh , the prime minister of israel , his name was barak , they met together in the white house -- and -- they almost came to an agreement -- to solve this problem -- and during clinton , eh , period -- they had , uh , this ( ( oslo ) ) a - eh , agreement . 
criminal trials/peterson scott peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife laci and their unborn son , and he now faces the death penalty . 
well , i -- i think it -- gets so much publicity because this -- this guy came out and -- claimed his wife was missing 
so , it 's crazy , but , they 're saying where they 're going to put him th eh , in the same prison next to charles manson or something like that . 
and , um , i think he s - m - was meeting women in the jail like that , too , when he was there , but he just got out of doing fifteen years and , you know , he was just , eh , central park , he had , uh , well , rough sex or something , with a woman in the park and they said he strangled her , or

um , actually she was pregnant for the baby . 
that was -- no , that was going to be their first . 
yeah , are you in a blue or a red state ? 
yeah , i 'm in indiana -- so , uh , 
but , uh , i live in a kind of a staunchly -- republican state . 
and , uh , well , i i -- i did read a a column today by , uh , a hispanic fellow and , uh , he was n't native born , he was from cuba , and , uh , he stated that , uh , we he was in the fifth grade and and , uh , uh , he was taking -- no , i guess he was in middle school and he was taking a civics class and and it was pointed out to him that , you know , he could never become president . 
well , you know , in one sense it is but then , i mean -- well , my grandparents came over , ellis island and everything , but when i think about , you know , a foreign person or maybe born in another country and coming here it doe - it does n't seem right in one sense for -- for them to be able to be president of this country . 
and so was his father and and clinton was , too , and and people actually that + alumina 
i watched a show on channel nine about bush and him being religious , spiritual , of course , but also religious when his father was n't , and -- i do n't know .

i think he was just sold to the american people . 
hello , my my name is obo in ithaca , new york 
hi , my na - -- hey , my name is ted and i 'm in jacksonville , florida .

i mean , if we do n't start looking inward and start taking care of things at home -- uh , right now , yeah , we are the biggest power in the world . 
if i - if if -- the united states is not the big dog , some power in the world is going to step up and be just that .

death of arafat ( 2 ) plo leader plo leader yasser arafat died in a paris hospital last week , after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death . 
should president bush or a senior us official have attended arafat 's funeral ? 
uh , well , let 's see , my past views were , uh -- illness-wise , ah -- i do n't think -- it helped him , being in the compound . 
but i do n't , you know , from just the generic point , or general point of view , it did n't help his illness once he got -- sick -- being in the compound , closed in like that with the arabs . 
uh , something like that , but , uh , i do n't know what the exact conditions were -- in that compound , but they could n't have been could n't have been , ah , conducive to someone of his age -- and of his health -- and as far as , as , ah , the united states sending a senior ~ us official , i think they should 've sent someone -- i do n't know how senior that person had to be . 
but it was n't -- like , ah , was n't bush , i definitely would n't send him , i do n't think you want to have him in that part of the world right now . 
yeah , i do n't think he should have went -- as a matter of fact , i do n't think any senior official should 've went , i do n't think -- secretary of state colin powell should have went .

should president bush or a senior us official have attended arafat 's funeral ? 
i 'm in delaware . 
i 'm in california . 
i i do n't know if it 'll move forward any better -- but , uh , this , uh , i 've heard our administration thinks it will . 
i think he was a block to the peace -- but i think it 's not only his doing , it 's also the -- you know , the , uh , more , uh , drastic elements of the ~ plo that , uh , that , uh , would n't allow him to pursue peace 
well , i i do n't remember who they sent , but they did send over some very -- low level state department person 
that we did or d - that we did not send our officials . 
and , i mean not that it would 've even been noticed -- in that regard had he -- had had our president or someone higher gone , but the fact that they did n't , that 's what 's really going to be noticed , you know what i mean ?
